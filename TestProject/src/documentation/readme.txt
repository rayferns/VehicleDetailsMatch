Part 2 -

Selenium/cucumber framework 

I have developed the BDD Page Object model framemwork as the design pattern. The project is a Maven Project with relevant dependencies in the POM.xml to support the test run. The Tests are againsts the car registration details from the excel files to match with the DVLA vehicle car details page on their website.

The project is divided into 4 parts.

1. Java codes for all the page objects
2. Step definations for all the page objects
3. Features in BDD cucumber format
4. Utilities to support the framemwork; Chrome browser and Excel Data tables

Both Part 1 and 2 are developed in Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: Oxygen.3 Release (4.7.3)

Screenshots of the test are not included, since the project didnt run successfully.
